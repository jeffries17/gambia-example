## 🔧 Ready for Your Competitor Data

### **To Add Competitor Destinations:**

**Option 1: Quick Code Addition**
```python
# Add this to tourism_insights_app.py in the DESTINATIONS section:
add_destination(
    name="Competitor Name (Location)", 
    file_path="path/to/competitor_data.json",
    description="Description of competitor destination",
    location="Geographic location", 
    destination_type="Tourism type"
)
```

**Option 2: Just Provide Data**
Send me the competitor tourism data in any format (JSON, CSV, raw reviews) and I'll:
1. Process it into the same format as Gambia data
2. Add it to the app automatically
3. Enable comparison features immediately

### **Data Format Expected**
The app expects JSON files with this structure (same as Gambia):
```json
{
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "destination": "Destination Name",
